**MCPE Cracker**
> A small tool for automatic cracking Minecraft for Windows Edition


**I do not suggestion play on a cracked Minecraft, use this at your own risk!**

This program is written in C# WinForm, all it does is replace the `Windows.ApplicationModel.Store.dll` in `C:\Windows\System32` with a cracked one, so Windows would think you have bought the actual Minecraft.

**This program does not work for `Minecraft Java Edition`**. I personally don't know how to crack it, but all you need to have is Xbox Game Pass to be able to play `Minecraft Java Edition`!

<br />

This program is thoroughly tested and developed on `Windows 11 Home Edition x64`, and it should work on **any Windows 11/10 Edition with x64 OS**.

<br />

Untried platforms:
* Windows 11 x86
* Windows 10 x86
* Any Windows OS below Windows 10
